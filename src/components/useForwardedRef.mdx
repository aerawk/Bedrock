# Stack

## Use case

The Stack is designed to literally 'stack' items on top of eachother while maintaining a consistent gap/gutter in between each item.

## How to install

```bash
  npm install @bedrock-layout/use-forwarded-ref
```

## Basic usage

```javascript
import useForwardedRef from '@bedrock-layout/use-forwarded-ref';

const ForwardedRefDiv = React.forwardRef(props,ref)=>{
    const innerRef = useForwardedRef(ref)
    // do something with innerRef
    return <div ref={innerRef} {...props}>
}
```

Then in your app you would use it like this:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  console.log(ref.current);
  return <ForwardedRefDiv ref={ref}>{...content}</ForwardedRefDiv>;
};
```
